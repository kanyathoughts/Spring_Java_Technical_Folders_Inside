                Closed Account Process Option - Help

    This option will allow closed accounts to not be removed
    from an existing relationship.  It also allows you to add
    new relationships using RPNEW and daily enrollment and
    add accounts using online functionality.  Closed accounts
    will not be added during auto enrollment or auto update.
    Valid entries are:

      N  Closed accounts will not be added to existing or new
         relationship and closed accounts will be removed from
         existing relationships.

      Y  Keep closed accounts on existing relationships and allow
         accounts to be added on existing relationships using
         online panels and allow accounts to be added during
         daily enrollment.
