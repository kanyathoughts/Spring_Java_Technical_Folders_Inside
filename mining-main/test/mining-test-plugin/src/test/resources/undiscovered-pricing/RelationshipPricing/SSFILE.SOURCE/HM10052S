             Transaction Accumulator Condition - Help

    This option forms a relationship between the accumulators.
    Required conditions must be defined before any other
    condition.  Required accumulators must meet their
    requirements.  If the previous accumulators before an 'Or'
    condition have met the requirement, the transaction
    validation passes.  Valid entries are:

      N       Accumulator not used.  Once an 'N' condition is
              reached, no more validation will be performed.
      R (Req) Required condition. The accumulator must meet the
              requirement. Accumulators with this condition must
              be defined before any other condition.
      O (Or)  'Or' conjuction is being used.
      A (And) 'And' conjunction is being used.
