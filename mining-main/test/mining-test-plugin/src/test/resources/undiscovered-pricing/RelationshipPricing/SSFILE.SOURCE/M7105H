                RP Demographic Qualifications - Help

     This panel is tied to MICM panel 7101 (RP Relationship
     Model) and is used to qualify customers for Relationship
     Pricing models based on demographic information stored in
     RCIF. It includes pre-defined token keywords, relations for
     the demographic qualifiers (equal, greater, less, etc.),
     value fields to compare the demographic qualifiers, and
     conjunction fields that can be entered to designate if a
     customer meets the model's demographic qualifications for
     the model.
