                  Account Processing Option - Help

    Allows restrictions on when a relationship qualifies to
    receive incentives.  Relationships can qualify for incentives
    daily or only on the Service Charge date of the primary
    account.  Valid entries are:

      A  Qualified for incentives on a daily basis.
      S  Qualified for incentives only on the Service Charge date
         of the primary account.
      T  Qualified on first Inc Qual run, than only on Service
         Charge date of the primary account.
      U  Qualified for incentives on a daily basis.  If the
         relationship fails incentive qualifications, it does not
         qualify again until after the Svc Chg date of prim acct.

    Note: If prim acct's SC date is zero, PO opt defaults to A.
